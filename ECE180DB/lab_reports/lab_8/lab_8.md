## Tasks Planned

- complete SVM classifier
    - record data base using new objects
    - modify data-base to include more gestures or remake if the live results are not what we expect
    - validate results on generated data base 
    - real time validation 
- user friendly
    - setup script for dependency both controller and application
    - can do powershell and `*.sh`
    - command line arguments for screen size, user name, and other currently hard coded paramaters
- possible performance boost
    - as we have removed several daemon threads, could add another for the purpose of sending acknowledgements for our server

## Tasks Completed
- user friendly
    - setup script created to allow for easy setup for devs
- discussed integration and implementation of new daemon threads to allow for better acknowledgement process
- finalized testing script for svm classifier, just final debug and testing left
- was a little light on completed tasks on my end as much time this week was lost to side effects from chemo

## Future Tasks
- complete SVM classifier
    - record data base using new objects
    - modify data-base to include more gestures or remake if the live results are not what we expect
    - validate results on generated data base 
    - real time validation
