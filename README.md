This repository is for the purpose of recording and providing version control for the courses I take in the 2020 Winter Quarter.

## ECE 133A

Introduction to numerical computing/analysis; analytic formulations versus numerical solutions; floating-point representations and rounding errors. Review of MATLAB; mathematical software. Linear equations; LU factorization; bounds on error; iterative methods for solving linear equations; conditioning and stability; complexity. Interpolation and approximation; splines. Zeros and roots of nonlinear equations. Linear least squares and orthogonal (QR) factorization; statistical interpretation. Numerical optimization; Newton method; nonlinear least squares. Numerical quadrature. Solving ordinary differential equations. Eigenvalues and singular values; QR algorithm; statistical applications.

## ECE 180DB

 Advanced systems design integrating communications, control, and signal processing subsystems. Introduction to advanced topics related to projects through lecture and laboratories. Open-ended projects vary each offering. Student teams create high-performance designs that manage trade-offs among subsystem components, including cost, performance, ease of use, and other real-world constraints. Oral and written presentation of project results.

## MATH 131

Rigorous introduction to foundations of real analysis; real numbers, point set topology in Euclidean space, functions, continuity.
